# Ghostty Windows Port — High-Level Plan

**Repo:** `marlboro-red/yuurei` (permanent fork of `ghostty-org/ghostty`)
**Working branch:** `main` *(since 2026-06-12; the old `windows-port`
staging branch was fast-forwarded into `main` when the project became a
standalone fork — upstream is tracked via the `upstream` remote and
merged in by release tag)*
**Date:** 2026-06-11
**Status:** **HISTORICAL (archived 2026-07-27).** The plan was executed;
see §0 below. Kept as the engineering log of the port — the audits,
incident reports, measurements, and dead ends recorded here are the "why"
behind decisions the code alone can't explain. **The live roadmap is
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).**

---

## 0. Outcome (2026-07-27 retrospective)

The port shipped. Everything phases 0–5 scoped — and a good deal the plan
called post-v1 — is on `main` and released (v0.1.0 → v0.2.12, portable
zips on GitHub Releases): tabs, splits, custom Mica frame, IME, profiles,
session restore, quick terminal, command palette, settings window,
inspector, search, session-wide perf work (17 ms median key-to-photon),
and shell integration for pwsh + Nushell. The fork has since crossed the
Zig 0.16 boundary and tracks upstream by merge.

A few decisions recorded below changed in practice; the text is kept
as-written, so read with these corrections:

- **§3 Win32 bindings:** zigwin32 was never adopted. Everything —
  including COM vtables (DXGI, DirectComposition, ITaskbarList,
  ITerminalHandoff) — is hand-written in `winapi.zig`/`dxgi.zig`/
  `defterm.zig`. The "COM is not hand-writable at sustainable quality"
  premise turned out to be wrong for the fork's narrow surface.
- **§3/§8 Distribution:** "signed, winget-installable" was dropped by
  choice (2026-06-12): GitHub Releases only, unsigned, no installer.
  Milestone M4 is superseded, not pending.
- **§5 Upstream tracking:** "weekly rebases" became **merges** of
  upstream (public history stays stable); cadence is per upstream sync,
  not weekly.
- **Phase 5 libxev vendoring:** the vendored libxev (IOCP lost-wakeup
  fix) was retired at the Zig 0.16 upgrade (2026-07-25) — upstream
  libxev's 0.16-era rewrite no longer has the bug (re-benchmarked:
  17.4 ms median, no regression). The dependency is upstream's package
  again; `vendor/libxev/` is gone.
- **Toolchain:** Zig 0.15.2 → **0.16.0** (2026-07-25 upgrade, ~13k
  lines of win32 apprt migrated).
- **Phase 4 "default-terminal registration" (listed as post-v1):** built
  after all — functionally complete (ConptyPackPseudoConsole adoption,
  COM server, resize + exit detection verified live) but shipped gated
  off pending a soak test. See the roadmap.

---

## 1. Goal and Strategy

Port Ghostty to native Windows by **adding a Windows platform layer inside the
real Ghostty tree** — not by building a separate application around extracted
pieces of it.

This is a deliberate course-correction from the previous attempt (the
standalone `yurei` repo, audited in its `REVIEW.md`). That attempt re-implemented
the renderer, font system, config, input, and app runtime from scratch and
consumed only `ghostty-vt` as a library. The result demonstrated the platform
techniques (ConPTY, custom frame, GDI) but made feature parity structurally
unreachable: every Ghostty feature outside the VT engine became something to
re-implement. Working upstream-in-tree inverts that — the core (`src/terminal/`,
`src/termio/`, `src/font/`, `src/config/`, `src/input/`, the renderer
abstraction) is platform-agnostic Zig we get for free, and parity holds *by
construction* because it is the same core.

**Definition of done (v1):** a signed, winget-installable Ghostty that runs
pwsh/cmd/WSL shells through ConPTY, renders with the existing cross-platform
GPU stack, supports tabs, correct international keyboard input and IME,
clipboard/paste, DPI awareness, and Windows 11-style chrome — built from this
fork with every commit verified by Windows CI.

What "done" explicitly is **not** (v1 non-goals): D3D11 renderer, DirectWrite
rasterization, splits parity, quick-terminal/tray, jump lists, default-terminal
registration, ARM64. These are post-v1 (§6, Phase 4+) or cut until evidence
demands them.

## 2. Ground Rules (lessons paid for already)

These are process rules, but they are the highest-leverage part of the plan.
Each one corresponds to a specific, documented failure of the previous attempt.

1. **Nothing exists until it runs on Windows.** Windows CI (`windows-latest`)
   building and testing every push is the *first* deliverable, before any port
   code. A Windows VM or machine is set up in week one. The previous attempt
   wrote 16k lines that were never once compiled for Windows.
2. **No stub returns fake success.** Unimplemented paths are
   `@panic("TODO: windows")` or compile errors behind `comptime` gates — never
   empty slices, hardcoded values, or flag-flips with green unit tests.
   Misrepresented state cost more than missing features last time.
3. **Vertical slices, always shippable.** Every phase ends with an artifact a
   human can type into. No subsystem gets an API surface before something
   consumes it.
4. **No optimization, no benchmarks, until the slice works.** Correctness
   first; measure on real Windows hardware afterward.
5. **Track upstream on its release cadence.** Merge upstream release tags
   into `main` (merge, never rebase — public history stays stable for a
   standalone project). Divergence is debt; keeping the win32 layer
   additive keeps each payment small.

## 3. Stack Decisions

Guiding rule: **native where users can perceive it, boring and already-working
where they can't.**

| Layer | Decision | Rejected alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| UI / windowing | Raw Win32 (`CreateWindowExW` + message loop + DWM), written in Zig as `src/apprt/win32.zig` (modeled on the `gtk` apprt, not the `embedded` C-API path) | WinUI 3 / XAML (runtime weight, Zig↔WinRT friction, App SDK churn); Qt/GTK (non-native); second-language app over libghostty (binding friction, unstable C API) |
| Win32/COM bindings | **Generated bindings via [zigwin32](https://github.com/marlersoft/zigwin32)** (from Microsoft's win32metadata), vendored/trimmed if dependency policy requires | Hand-written bindings (the prior attempt hand-wrote ~1k lines: mostly right, still had wrong DLL attributions, wrong calling-convention constant, and zero COM machinery — COM vtables/IIDs are not hand-writable at sustainable quality) |
| PTY | ConPTY, **vendoring `conpty.dll` + `OpenConsole.exe` from the Windows Terminal repo (MIT)** so ConPTY behavior ships on our release schedule, not the user's Windows build | OS-installed conhost (support matrix hostage to Windows version); winpty (legacy) |
| GPU rendering | **Existing OpenGL backend to ship**; D3D11 as a post-v1 backend, triggered only by field evidence (GL driver crashes on Intel iGPUs, RDP problems) | D3D12/Vulkan (explicit-sync complexity, zero payoff for textured quads); Direct2D as primary (loses the shared atlas architecture) |
| Font discovery | **DirectWrite early** (`IDWriteFontCollection`, `IDWriteFontFallback::MapCharacters`) — missing fonts and broken CJK/emoji fallback are immediately user-visible | fontconfig on Windows |
| Text shaping | HarfBuzz (already in tree) — permanent | `IDWriteTextAnalyzer` (worse API, no gain) |
| Glyph rasterization | FreeType (already in tree) — possibly permanent; DWrite/ClearType demoted to "only if users complain" (subpixel AA interacts badly with GPU-composited transparent backgrounds; Windows Terminal largely ships grayscale AA anyway) | DWrite raster as a headline goal |
| IME | imm32 (`WM_IME_*`, composition window at cursor cell) first | TSF (COM swamp; escalation path only if CJK users report edge cases) |
| Toolchain | Zig's bundled toolchain (cross-compiles/links COFF with bundled MinGW libs — no Visual Studio needed); develop anywhere, **run** on Windows CI + hardware; Zig version pinned to Ghostty's | MSVC dependency |
| Distribution | winget + Scoop first (zero infra, solves updates); **code-signing cert budgeted early** (SmartScreen kills unsigned downloads); MSI/MSIX later | MSIX-first; custom Sparkle-style updater for v1 |

---

## 4. Phases

Estimates assume one developer, part-time-to-full-time, consistent with
upstream's original 6–12 month framing. The difference from the old plan:
a usable terminal exists at ~month 2–3, not at the end.

### 4a. Current-state audit (2026-06-11, this branch, Zig 0.15.2, Windows 11)

The plan above was drafted from the previous attempt's worldview ("16k lines
never compiled for Windows"). The in-tree reality is far better:

**What already works:**

- `zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-windows -Dapp-runtime=none` **compiles and links
  clean** on this machine, today, with zero changes. With `apprt=none` no exe
  is produced by design (`build.zig:177` — "Runtime none is libghostty"); the
  build emits `ghostty-internal.dll`/`-static.lib` (the full GUI core: App,
  Surface, termio, font, OpenGL renderer, config, input — the same lib the
  macOS app links) plus `ghostty-vt.dll` and headers. The feared "pervasive
  POSIX assumptions in core" have largely been paid down by upstream.
- **Upstream already carries real Windows scaffolding:**
  - `src/pty.zig` — `WindowsPty` selected by `builtin.os.tag`: pipe creation,
    `CreatePseudoConsole` / `ResizePseudoConsole` / `ClosePseudoConsole`.
  - `src/Command.zig` — `startWindows()`: `CreateProcessW` with the
    pseudoconsole attribute list, UTF-16 command line, handle inheritance.
  - `src/termio/Exec.zig` — a `threadMainWindows` read-thread branch exists
    (completeness audited in Phase 1 below).
  - `src/os/` — `windows.zig` hand bindings (kernel32 + ConPTY surface);
    `pipe.zig`, `file.zig`, `open.zig`, `path.zig` already gated for Windows.
- **Upstream CI already tests Windows:** `test.yml` has `test-windows`
  (`zig build -Dapp-runtime=none test` on a Windows runner) and
  `build-libghostty-windows-gnu`. ConPTY/termio code is *unit*-tested upstream
  on every push — to ghostty-org. All jobs are gated
  `if: github.repository == 'ghostty-org/ghostty'` and run on namespace-cloud
  runners, so **none of it runs on this fork**.

**What the audit found missing (feeds the phases below):**

- No CI on this fork (gated jobs + unavailable runners) → fork-own workflow.
- `src/os/` is in better shape than a first-pass grep suggests (verified by
  reading, not just searching): `hostname.zig` has a `GetComputerNameA` arm,
  `homedir.zig` has `homeWindows`, and `passwd.zig`'s
  `@compileError("not available on windows")` is an honest Rule-2 gate whose
  only call sites are Darwin-gated. Remaining watch item: `env.zig` gate
  coverage as new call sites appear.
- `threadMainWindows` quit-pipe path calls `posix.close()` on a Windows
  HANDLE; pipes are anonymous (`CreatePipe`), not overlapped named pipes —
  whether that supports the wait model needs a runtime test, not a code read.
- No headless ConPTY integration test anywhere (upstream's Windows tests are
  unit tests only — nothing spawns a real shell and round-trips output).
- **The GLFW apprt no longer exists.** Deleted upstream 2025-07-04
  (`fb9c52ecf` "Nuke GLFW from Orbit"). The only runtimes are `none`
  (libghostty) and `gtk`. Phase 2 as originally written is impossible; see the
  revised Phase 2.

### Phase 0 — Environment + fork CI green (days, not weeks)

Originally scoped at 2–4 weeks as the critical path; the audit (§4a) shows
upstream already did most of it. What remains:

- [x] Windows 11 machine; Zig 0.15.2 (matches `minimum_zig_version`).
- [x] `zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-windows -Dapp-runtime=none` compiles —
  verified locally, zero changes needed.
- [x] Fork CI: `.github/workflows/windows-port.yml` on `windows-latest`
  (upstream's Windows jobs never run here, §4a): build `apprt=none` + run
  `zig build -Dapp-runtime=none test` on every push to `windows-port`.
  *Written; goes live on first push.*
- [x] `zig build -Dapp-runtime=none test` passes on this machine — the full
  unit suite is green natively on Windows with zero changes (2026-06-11).
- [x] Close the known `src/os/` runtime gaps — audit found they were already
  closed upstream (§4a): hostname, homedir, pipe, file, path, open all have
  real Windows implementations; passwd is honestly comptime-gated and
  unreachable on Windows.
- **Exit criterion (unchanged):** core + `apprt=none` compiles for
  `x86_64-windows` in *this fork's* CI; platform-agnostic unit tests pass on
  Windows.

### Phase 1 — ConPTY backend in `src/termio/` (2–3 weeks)

**Audit note (§4a): this is completion-and-verification work, not greenfield.**
`WindowsPty`, `Command.startWindows()`, and `Exec.threadMainWindows` already
exist upstream. The honest status is "written, unit-tested, never proven
against a live shell end-to-end." Concrete work list from the audit:

- [x] ~~Fix `threadMainWindows` quit-pipe teardown~~ Audited 2026-06-11: the
  reported `posix.close()`-on-HANDLE is a false alarm — Zig's `std.posix.close`
  calls `CloseHandle` on Windows. The *real* bug found: `ReadFile` failing
  with `ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE` (the documented EOF when the pseudoconsole side
  closes, i.e. every child exit) was routed to `unreachable` — a guaranteed
  crash on shell exit. **Fixed**: `BROKEN_PIPE`/`HANDLE_EOF`/`INVALID_HANDLE`
  now exit the read thread gracefully, mirroring the POSIX branch.
- [x] Audit the pipe/wait model. Resolved 2026-06-11: upstream's design is
  sound — the pty *input* pipe is already an overlapped **named** pipe
  (required by libxev's IOCP stream writes; see comment in
  `pty.zig:WindowsPty.open`); the *output* pipe is anonymous but read by a
  dedicated thread with synchronous `ReadFile`, unblocked at shutdown by
  `CancelIoEx` from `threadExit` (quit byte + cancel, then `join`). No
  rewrite needed.
- [x] Verify exit detection goes through the **process handle** — confirmed:
  `Command.wait` uses `WaitForSingleObject(hProcess)` +
  `GetExitCodeProcess`; covered by the new round-trip test.
- [ ] Verify env block (`CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT`), cwd, command-line
  quoting and the 32K limit in `startWindows()` against the checklist below.
  (Env/cwd/quoting have upstream unit tests; the 32K limit and quoting edge
  cases still need targeted tests.)
- [~] **The actual deliverable: headless ConPTY integration tests** — two
  landed 2026-06-11, both passing natively:
  1. `Command.zig` "windows pseudo console round-trip": cmd.exe on a real
     pseudoconsole, output round-trips through the pty pipe, exit via the
     process handle.
  2. `termio/Exec.zig` "conpty shell exit via xev stream write and process
     watcher": the exec stack minus Termio — input written to the pty's
     overlapped named pipe through `xev.Stream` (IOCP) and exit detected by
     `xev.Process` (job-object watcher), the two Windows paths nothing else
     exercised. Confirmed `xev.Process` IS implemented for IOCP (job objects
     + `GetExitCodeProcess`), retiring that open risk.

  Found while writing #2 — **libxev IOCP pitfall**: `loop.run(.no_wait)`
  never polls the completion port (`tick(0)` breaks before
  `GetQueuedCompletionStatusEx`), so IO completions only ever arrive from
  blocking runs. Real termio runs `.until_done` and is unaffected, but any
  future Windows code that pumps `.no_wait` will silently never complete IO.
  Candidate upstream libxev issue/fix.

  Still open: a test through the full `termio.Thread`/`Termio` stack
  (exercises `threadMainWindows` + `processExit` wiring), resize assertions,
  pwsh coverage.
- [~] Vendor OpenConsole/conpty.dll (MIT, from Windows Terminal repo); fall
  back to OS ConPTY when absent. *(2026-06-12: the loader side is done —
  ConPTY entry points resolve at first use, preferring a conpty.dll next
  to the exe via `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_APPLICATION_DIR` (no cwd
  DLL-planting), falling back to kernel32; which provider loaded is
  logged. Remaining: acquiring/shipping the OpenConsole binaries is a
  Phase 4 packaging-pipeline step.)*

Reference design (kept from v2.0 — measure upstream's code against this):
- New PTY backend behind the existing abstraction in `termio/`:
  - **Named pipes with overlapped I/O** (anonymous pipes cannot participate in
    waits — proven the hard way last time).
  - `CreatePseudoConsole` + attribute-list `CreateProcessW`
    (`PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE`; the
    `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES`-with-NULL-handles inheritance trick).
  - Environment block (`CREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT`) with parent inheritance,
    cwd, heap-allocated command line (32K limit), argument quoting.
  - Correct lifecycle: `errdefer` the HPCON; shutdown = drain/close pipes →
    `ClosePseudoConsole` → wait on **process handle** → terminate as last
    resort. Exit detection via the process handle, never via read()-returns-0.
  - Wire into Ghostty's existing I/O thread model (`termio/Thread.zig`) — the
    threading architecture already exists upstream; do not invent one.
- **Exit criterion:** CI proves a real shell spawns, echoes, resizes, and its
  death is detected — with no UI existing yet.

### Phase 2 — Proof of life: minimal win32 apprt skeleton (3–5 weeks)

**Revised (§4a): the GLFW vehicle no longer exists.** Upstream deleted the
GLFW apprt on 2025-07-04 (`fb9c52ecf` "Nuke GLFW from Orbit"); resurrecting it
in-fork was considered and rejected — it would mean reverting a deliberate
upstream deletion, carrying a dead runtime through weekly rebases (Rule 5),
against apprt interfaces that have drifted a year past it, for zero upstream
value. The de-risking argument for GLFW is also weaker than when v2.0 was
drafted: the core already compiles for Windows and upstream unit-tests it in
CI, so there is much less left to de-risk.

Instead, proof of life is the **smallest possible `src/apprt/win32.zig`** —
the start of Phase 3's runtime, built skeleton-first:

- [x] Register `.win32` in `src/apprt/runtime.zig` + build wiring
  (2026-06-11): `src/apprt/win32/{App,Surface}.zig` satisfy the comptime
  apprt interface with honest `@panic("TODO: windows")` bodies;
  `renderer/OpenGL.zig` got `.win32` arms (panics, pending WGL);
  `zig build -Dapp-runtime=win32` produces a working `ghostty.exe` —
  `+version` reports runtime `.win32`, font engine `.freetype_windows`,
  renderer OpenGL, libxev iocp. In fork CI on every push. Not yet the
  Windows default — that flip happens at this phase's exit criterion.
  *(2026-06-11, later: now a GUI-subsystem binary — no console window on
  launch. The MSVC CRT's WinMain requirement is sidestepped by keeping
  the console CRT entry (`/ENTRY:mainCRTStartup`) under
  `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS`, and CLI/log output from terminals works via
  `AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS)` at startup.)*
- [x] One window class, `CreateWindowExW`, bare message loop, **standard
  system frame**. Done 2026-06-11: `App.run` is a real
  `GetMessageW`/`PeekMessageW` loop modeled on the deleted GLFW apprt's
  contract (wait → dispatch → `core_app.tick` → deferred surface closes);
  `wakeup` posts a `WM_NULL` thread message. Win32 calls go through
  hand-written externs in `win32/winapi.zig` (plain functions only — the
  plan's zigwin32 decision is about COM and still stands for when
  DirectWrite/TSF arrive).
- [x] WGL context creation hosting the existing OpenGL renderer. Done:
  legacy `wglCreateContext` (explicit-attribs core context is a TODO),
  context handed from main thread to renderer thread via
  `surfaceInit`/`finalizeSurfaceInit`/`threadEnter` arms; viewport synced
  from the client rect in `drawFrameStart`; `SwapBuffers` in
  `drawFrameEnd`. Driver gave GL 4.6.
- [x] Crude input: `WM_KEYDOWN` (VK→key map) submits without text; if
  unconsumed, the queued `WM_CHAR` completes it with layout-cooked UTF-8
  (surrogate pairs reassembled) — the GLFW pairing adapted to the
  TranslateMessage trap. Known-crude, documented in-code: no IME, no AltGr
  discrimination (reports ctrl+alt), no dead keys, partial VK map. Also:
  focus, resize, mouse wheel, and CF_UNICODETEXT clipboard both ways.
  Mouse buttons/motion (selection) not wired yet.
- [x] Font discovery: nothing needed for proof of life — upstream's
  `freetype_windows` discovery backend plus embedded JetBrains Mono just
  worked.
- [x] Wired to the Phase 1 ConPTY backend.
- [x] **Deliverable: actual Ghostty** — real renderer, real shaping, real
  config — running a real shell in an ugly window on Windows. **Achieved
  2026-06-11**: cmd.exe banner + prompt render with JetBrains Mono;
  typed commands round-trip live; the shell sets the window title via OSC.
- From this point every change regresses against a known-good baseline
  instead of assembling a non-working system.
- [x] Mouse: buttons + motion with capture (drag-selection works — verified
  end-to-end by drag-selecting in the live window and reading the result
  off the clipboard), wheel scrolling. Mouse-shape cursors still TODO.
- [x] Keybinds actually fire: keybind triggers match on the unshifted
  codepoint, so `WM_KEYDOWN` now derives it from the layout via
  `MapVirtualKeyW(VK_TO_CHAR)`. Verified live: `ctrl+shift+c` copies the
  selection, `ctrl+shift+v` pastes through the bracketed-paste path.
- [x] Fuller VK map: OEM punctuation, numpad operators, locks,
  print-screen/pause/menu, left/right modifier discrimination via the
  extended-key bit and right-shift scancode, numpad enter.
- [x] `WM_DPICHANGED` (the PMv2 manifest upstream already ships made us
  per-monitor-aware from day one): apply the suggested rect, forward the
  new scale to `contentScaleCallback`. (Single-monitor machine — code
  follows the documented contract but a real multi-DPI drag is untested.)
- [x] SGR colors verified rendering in the live window (16-color fg/bg).
- [x] IME via imm32 (2026-06-12): `WM_IME_COMPOSITION` routes
  `GCS_RESULTSTR` commits through `keyCallback` and `GCS_COMPSTR` through
  `preeditCallback` (inline preedit; the system composition window is
  suppressed); composition UI positioned at the cursor cell via
  `imePoint()` + `ImmSetCompositionWindow`. **Implemented to the imm32
  contract but not yet exercised with a real CJK IME — needs manual
  verification by a CJK user before it can be called done.** TSF remains
  the documented escalation path.
- [x] Default shell prefers PowerShell (2026-06-12): pwsh.exe →
  powershell.exe → cmd.exe, resolved via the process search path.
  Verified: live window spawns pwsh. (Shell-integration injection for
  pwsh does not exist upstream for any platform — new work, tracked under
  Phase 3's shell-integration item.)
- [~] VT conformance (2026-06-12): a vttest-style probe through the live
  window passed cleanly — cursor addressing, SGR attribute set
  (bold/italic/underline/reverse/strike), 16/256/truecolor, DEC special
  graphics line drawing, CJK wide characters, emoji, DECSTBM scroll
  regions (verified exact post-scroll state), right-margin wrap, OSC
  title. Still open: the full interactive vttest — needs WSL (not
  installed on the dev machine) or a POSIX host to run vttest inside
  Ghostty.
- [x] Modal-loop timer (2026-06-12): core app keeps ticking during
  interactive move/resize via a WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE-scoped 16ms timer.
- [x] `initial_size` action honored (client→window rect via
  `AdjustWindowRectExForDpi`).
- [x] Stability soak (2026-06-12): 45+ minutes under continuous scrolling
  output (timestamped directory listings in a tight loop), memory stable
  at ~78MB, no crash. Longer multi-day soaks accumulate naturally from
  daily driving.
- [x] pwsh shell integration (2026-06-12) — **new feature, exists for no
  platform upstream**: `src/shell-integration/pwsh/ghostty.ps1` (5.1- and
  7+-compatible) emits OSC 133 prompt marks (A/B/C/D with exit codes),
  OSC 7 cwd, and OSC 0 titles via prompt + PSConsoleHostReadLine wraps;
  auto-injected by rewriting the command to `-NoExit -Command
  . <script>` (returns a direct command so spawn-layer quoting is exact;
  bails on -Command/-File/-EncodedCommand/-NoExit). Verified live:
  injection log, error-free startup, title following cwd via our OSC.
- [x] `zig build` on Windows now defaults to the win32 runtime
  (2026-06-12) — the exe is the default Windows artifact.
- [x] Dark title bar via DWMWA_USE_IMMERSIVE_DARK_MODE, following theme
  changes (2026-06-12).
- [x] Multiple windows (2026-06-12): `new_window` keybind/action spawns
  additional surfaces, each a top-level window with its own renderer
  thread and WGL context — verified live (targeted F9 → second window).
  `new_tab` opens a window as an interim (honest log) until the real
  tab strip lands with the custom-frame work; `close_window` wired to
  the deferred-close path.
- [x] **vttest through WSL inside the live window (2026-06-12)**: WSL1 +
  Ubuntu installed (firmware virtualization disabled on the dev machine,
  so WSL2 unavailable); vttest 2.7 driven interactively inside Ghostty.
  Results: test 1 cursor movements — E-frame screen pixel-perfect,
  autowrap screen complete I–Z/i–z margins in order; menu 11.6 ISO-6429
  colors — full 64-combination fg/bg matrix correct in both bright
  variants; menu 11.8 xterm set-window-title — OSC title flowed
  WSL→ConPTY→core→strip and the OS window title matched exactly.
  (Methodology note: screenshot captures can catch screens mid-redraw;
  judge only settled screens.)
- **Exit criterion (still open):** screenshot in the README. Everything
  else on the Phase 2 list is done.

**Incident (2026-06-12): GPU driver timeouts (LiveKernelEvent 141).**
Hours of accumulated test instances triggered bursts of video-engine
timeout kernel events (WER `Kernel_141` reports), destabilizing the
whole desktop (GPU device-loss kills unrelated apps). Two win32 apprt
defects were the likely trigger, both fixed:
1. The swap interval was never set — config `vsync = true` was ignored
   and SwapBuffers ran unthrottled. Now `wglSwapIntervalEXT(1)` on
   renderer-thread enter (warns if unavailable).
2. Hidden tab hosts kept presenting; drawFrameEnd now skips SwapBuffers
   for invisible windows.
Post-fix: ~2% of one core at idle, no driver events. This validates the
plan's "GL driver quality" risk-register entry — on NVIDIA, not Intel.

### Phase 3 — Native Win32 apprt, completed (2–3 months)

Fill out the Phase 2 skeleton in `src/apprt/win32.zig` until it is a real
runtime like `gtk.zig`.

- Window class, message loop, custom frame: `WM_NCCALCSIZE`/`WM_NCHITTEST`/
  DWM Mica/`DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea`, the flicker trifecta (null
  background brush, `WM_ERASEBKGND`, `SWP_NOCOPYBITS`), modal-loop timer so
  output keeps flowing during drags, PMv2 DPI awareness **queried at window
  creation**, `WM_DPICHANGED`. *(The prior attempt's frame code validated this
  recipe in Zig — salvage the knowledge, rewrite against generated bindings.)*
  - [x] Prerequisite landed (2026-06-12): the GL surface renders into a
    disabled child window ("ghostty-host") instead of the top-level
    window, so the parent can own GDI-painted chrome (tab strip, caption
    buttons) that the GL swap chain can't overdraw. Verified zero
    behavioral change: rendering, input passthrough (disabled child →
    parent), resize tracking.
  - [x] Custom frame landed (2026-06-12): `WM_NCCALCSIZE` removes the
    standard title bar (keeping DefWindowProc's left/right/bottom resize
    borders + maximize inset); `WM_NCHITTEST` synthesizes the top resize
    border, drags via HTCAPTION, and exempts the caption buttons; the
    strip is GDI-painted (theme-aware background, centered title, Segoe
    MDL2 caption glyphs with hover states including red close). All
    verified live: drag, maximize/restore with correct inset, close via
    button → clean exit. A frame recalc (`SWP_FRAMECHANGED`) is forced
    after the wndproc is wired since the initial frame computes before
    that. *(Test-harness note: PowerShell-driven clicks need
    `SetThreadDpiAwarenessContext(-4)` + foregrounding — coordinates are
    otherwise DPI-virtualized and clicks land on overlapping windows.)*
  - [x] **Tabs (2026-06-12)**: the apprt split into `Window.zig` (one
    top-level window owning frame, strip, input routing) and
    `Surface.zig` (one tab: GL host child + WGL context + core
    surface). The strip draws real tabs (active/hover states, per-tab
    close, "+" button) ahead of the caption buttons; switching toggles
    host-child visibility with focus callbacks. `new_tab`, `goto_tab`
    (previous/next/last/index), `close_tab`, and `close_window` actions
    wired. Verified live end-to-end: "+" spawned a second shell, typed
    text landed only in the active tab, switching preserved both
    sessions' content, closing a tab re-laid-out the strip with the
    window surviving.
  - Tab drag-reorder + `move_tab` landed 2026-06-12 (tabs activate on
    press; captured drag reorders across slots; move_tab wraps
    cyclically — all verified live via posted-message input).
  - Tab tooltips landed 2026-06-12 (comctl32, one tool per slot,
    explicit TTM_RELAYEVENT; verified to API contract, hover popup
    visual check pending normal desktop use — dev machine state
    suppresses popups).
  - Scrollbars landed 2026-06-12: a native SCROLLBAR control in a
    reserved column beside each GL host, fed by the core `scrollbar`
    action (SetScrollInfo range/page/pos), WM_VSCROLL →
    `scroll_to_row` with 32-bit track positions, focus handed back to
    the terminal on SB_ENDSCROLL. Verified live: thumb tracked 200
    lines of scrollback and SB_PAGEUP moved the viewport.
  - Remaining polish: Mica/backdrop.
- **Input gets disproportionate budget — it is where real terminals fail:**
  - The `TranslateMessage` ordering trap (handled `WM_KEYDOWN` must swallow its
    queued `WM_CHAR`).
  - UTF-16 surrogate-pair reassembly in `WM_CHAR`; `WM_UNICHAR`.
  - AltGr discrimination via lParam bit 24 / scancode, not `GetKeyState`;
    dead keys (`WM_DEADCHAR`).
  - IME via imm32, candidate window positioned at the cursor cell.
  - Route everything through Ghostty's existing `input/` key encoding (kitty
    protocol, modifyOtherKeys come for free — do not write a parallel encoder).
- Clipboard (Unicode text both directions, bracketed paste through core's
  existing handling, format listener), mouse reporting through core, tabs via
  Ghostty's surface/tab model, GDI-free rendering (the OpenGL surface hosts in
  the Win32 window).
- Theme detection (registry + `WM_SETTINGCHANGE`), `config` paths
  (`%APPDATA%\ghostty\config`), shell-integration injection for
  pwsh/cmd-via-Clink/WSL.
- **Exit criterion:** `-Dapp-runtime=win32` is the default Windows build with
  tabs, IME, paste, and DPI all real — nothing on the Phase 2 skeleton's
  `@panic("TODO")` list remains reachable in normal use.

### Phase 3a — macOS feature-parity sweep (2026-06-12, in progress)

Working down the gap list from the macOS comparison audit:

- [x] `open_config`: opens the config file in notepad via ShellExecuteW
  (no .ghostty file association exists). Verified live: F8 keybind →
  notepad with the config path.
- [x] `ring_bell`: taskbar/caption attention flash; beep only when the
  window is in the background.
- [x] `desktop_notification` (2026-06-12, real): a lazily created tray
  notify icon + NIF_INFO balloon tip, which Win 10/11 renders as a
  toast — no AUMID/package identity needed (WinRT toasts can replace
  this after packaging). Source window still flashes. Verified to the
  OS boundary (dev machine has ToastEnabled=0 so Windows declines to
  render). **Correction (same day):** the earlier finding that ConPTY
  consumes OSC 9/777 was wrong — it was an artifact of a broken test
  harness (bare posted WM_CHARs are dropped by charEvent's
  TranslateMessage-trap design; typing needs KEYDOWN+CHAR pairs).
  Retested properly: OSC 9 flows through ConPTY end-to-end into the
  toast handler; OSC 777 likewise (the second emission only hit
  core's 1/sec notification rate limiter).
- [x] Clipboard confirmation: unsafe pastes (core's UnsafePaste) and
  OSC 52 reads/writes now prompt with a native yes/no warning dialog,
  defaulting to No. Verified live: multi-line paste into cmd.exe raised
  the dialog; No blocked the paste.
- [x] Quick terminal + global keybinds (2026-06-12): `global:`-flagged
  keybinds register as Win32 system hotkeys (`RegisterHotKey`, null-hwnd
  thread messages handled in the run loop; trigger→VK mapping for
  letters/digits/F-keys/backquote/space); app-scoped hotkey actions
  dispatch through `core_app.performAction`. The quick terminal is a
  topmost tool window docked to the top of the primary monitor (full
  width, 40% height) that hides on focus loss, toggled by
  `toggle_quick_terminal`; a hidden quick terminal never keeps the app
  alive as the last window. Verified live: a real system-wide
  Ctrl+Alt+G summoned it (0,0 full-width) and a second fire hid it.
  *(Also fixed by this work's testing: `LoadCursorW` MAKEINTRESOURCE
  ids tripped Debug alignment checks for odd ids like IDC_IBEAM —
  latent crash on any text-cursor mouse shape.)*
- [x] **Splits (2026-06-12)** — built on upstream's shared
  `datastruct/split_tree.zig` (`SplitTree(Surface)`; surfaces gained the
  ref/unref view contract). Each tab is now a split tree of surfaces;
  layout comes from the tree's `spatial()` slots mapped onto the
  terminal area with a 2px gap (parent paints the gap background,
  `WS_CLIPCHILDREN` protects the GL hosts). Input routes positionally:
  clicks focus the split under the cursor, wheel scrolls the hovered
  split, keyboard/IME follow split focus. Actions wired: `new_split`
  (all four directions), `goto_split` (spatial + wrapped prev/next),
  `resize_split`, `equalize_splits`, `toggle_split_zoom`; closing a
  shell collapses its split, closing the last closes the tab. Verified
  live: split right, marker typed into the focused new pane only,
  `goto_split` moved focus (solid vs hollow cursors), `exit` collapsed
  back to a full-width survivor with history intact.
- [x] **Split divider drag + snap layouts (2026-06-12)** — dividers are
  draggable (captured drag updates the ratio in place, 5–95% clamp,
  WE/NS resize cursors over the gap); re-laid-out surfaces get an
  explicit `refreshCallback()` because an idle surface never presents
  after a resize, which left stale pixels in newly exposed regions.
  The maximize button reports `HTMAXBUTTON` from `WM_NCHITTEST` (snap
  layouts flyout eligibility) with NC mouse handlers for hover paint
  and click → maximize/restore. Verified live: drag re-rendered both
  panes cleanly; maximize click zoomed and a second click restored the
  exact prior rect. (The flyout itself didn't appear under synthetic
  hover on the dev machine — but neither did Notepad's, so the hit-test
  contract is as verified as the environment allows.)
- [x] **Command palette (2026-06-12)** — a native borderless popup
  (own window class, CS_DROPSHADOW, GDI-painted like the strip) over
  the active window: typed case-insensitive filter over the
  `command-palette-entry` commands (titles + descriptions), keyboard
  navigation, mouse hover/click/wheel, Escape/focus-loss dismissal;
  Enter executes via the focused surface's `performBindingAction`.
  Default binding Ctrl+Shift+P works out of the box. Verified live:
  filter "split right" narrowed to one command and Enter created the
  split.
- [x] **Background opacity (2026-06-12)** — `background-opacity < 1`
  maps to window-level alpha (WS_EX_LAYERED +
  SetLayeredWindowAttributes); `toggle_background_opacity` flips
  between configured and opaque. Per-pixel GL alpha (true blur/Mica
  behind text) needs a DirectComposition swap chain — future work.
  Verified live at 0.85 with the toggle.
- [x] **Inspector (2026-06-12)** — `inspector` toggle/show/hide opens a
  native top-level window hosting the shared Dear ImGui inspector
  (own WGL context on the main thread, ~30fps timer +
  `render_inspector` repaints, ImGui io input translation, DPI-scaled
  style). Found live: the imgui GL3 backend leaves GL_SCISSOR_TEST on,
  confining the next clear to the last clip rect. The surface owns its
  inspector window and tears it down before the core surface dies.
- Remaining from the audit, in rough order: settings GUI, auto-update,
  WinRT toasts.

### Phase 3b — survey-driven gaps (2026-06-12)

Surveyed the other Windows ports (amanthanvi/winghostty,
deblasis/wintty, InsipidPoint/ghostty-windows) and closed the cheap
user-facing gaps they exposed:

- [x] **open_url** — Ctrl+click on detected/OSC 8 links opens via
  ShellExecuteW behind an http/https/mailto allowlist (a bare path or
  file URL would execute; terminal output is untrusted). Verified
  live: file URL refused with a log, https link opened the browser.
- [x] **File drag-and-drop** — WM_DROPFILES pastes dropped paths
  through the normal unsafe-paste-confirmed path, double-quoted when
  cmd/pwsh would split them. Verified live via a fabricated HDROP.
- [x] **Find-in-terminal** — search bar popup docked top-right; core
  owns matching/lifecycle (search, navigate_search, end_search in;
  start_search, search_total, search_selected out). Verified live
  with highlighted matches, live counts, and selection navigation.
- [x] **win32-input-mode (mode 9001) (2026-07-23)** — conhost requests
  full-fidelity key encoding (CSI Vk;Sc;Uc;Kd;Cs;Rc _) when a client
  uses ReadConsoleInput. Implemented as a terminal mode (modes.zig
  9001, refusable via the `win32-input-mode` config) plus a Windows
  arm in the shared key encoder (key_encode.zig win32InputMode); the
  win32 apprt carries VK/scancode/extended-bit on KeyEvent and the
  lock/side modifier state in currentMods. Shipped together with the
  vendored ConPTY bump to the 1.25 line (kitty TerminalInput), which
  keeps kitty-negotiating VT clients (Claude Code) at full fidelity
  while INPUT_RECORD clients (crossterm TUIs like Codex) now see real
  modifiers — the motivating bug was Shift+Enter doing nothing in
  Codex. Unit tests cover the encoder (shift+enter press/release,
  ctrl chords, enhanced keys, surrogate pairs, legacy fallback); the
  live matrix (pwsh ReadKey shows `Enter [Shift]`, Codex newline,
  Claude Code unchanged, `win32-input-mode = false` escape hatch) is
  tracked in the PR.
- Deliberately skipped from the survey: session restore (large,
  winghostty has it), signed installers/winget/Scoop (distribution
  stays GitHub-only by choice), WinUI/DX12 rearchitecture (wintty's
  approach; our WGL renderer measures at conhost parity).

### Phase 4 — Ship + polish strictly by user pain (ongoing)

**Distribution decision (2026-06-12): GitHub Releases only.** No code
signing, no winget/Scoop, no installer — by choice. Landed:

- [x] Inverted-icon branding (derivative of upstream's MIT artwork,
  attribution + swap-on-request commitment in README), embedded via
  dist/windows/ghostty.rc with a real VERSIONINFO (ProductName yuurei,
  0.1.0), wired to the window class and tray icon.
- [x] vendor/conpty: conpty.dll + OpenConsole.exe from
  microsoft/terminal (MIT, NOTICE.md), shipped beside the exe in
  releases. Best 10MB burst with it: 885 ms vs 1.25–1.5 s in-box
  baseline (noisy machine, but the best time recorded). Bumped
  2026-07-23 to the NuGet `Microsoft.Windows.Console.ConPTY`
  `1.25.260710002-preview` pair — the 1.25 line's kitty TerminalInput
  is load-bearing for win32-input-mode (see Phase 3b); bump to the
  stable 1.25 nupkg when it ships.
- [x] .github/workflows/release.yml: v* tag → ReleaseFast build +
  suite → portable zip (bin/, share/, LICENSE, README,
  THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES) + SHA256 → GitHub Release.
- [x] **Native settings window (2026-06-14)** — closes the "no settings
  GUI" gap vs Windows Terminal. A curated dialog
  (src/apprt/win32/SettingsWindow.zig) over the most-changed options:
  Theme (enumerated from the bundled themes dir), Font size, Cursor
  style, Background opacity, Blink-the-cursor, plus Open-config and
  Close. Reachable via the open_config binding (Ctrl+, / command
  palette), which on win32 now opens this GUI instead of notepad (the
  raw file is one button away). Deliberately plain user32/gdi32 (native
  comboboxes/checkbox/buttons, GDI-painted labels) — no
  DirectComposition/swapchain/GL, so unlike the parked acrylic work it
  carries zero compositor-hang risk. Operates on the config file as
  text: reads current values to pre-select controls, rewrites the one
  changed `key = value` line preserving comments and every other line,
  then triggers a normal reload so edits apply live. Verified
  end-to-end on Windows 11. Possible follow-ups: dark-themed controls
  (owner-draw), Tab/Esc dialog navigation, font-family enumeration,
  tighter sizing at high DPI. **Restyled custom-drawn (2026-06-14):** the
  initial version used raw Win32 controls (an archaic Win95 dialog); now
  custom-drawn to match the command palette — theme-aware body, dark
  caption, rounded pill dropdowns opening a styled scrollable list
  popup, custom checkbox, rounded buttons.
- [x] **Frosted background blur (2026-06-14)** — the *safe* half of the
  acrylic ask. `background-blur` frosts the desktop behind a translucent
  window via the DWM accent policy (SetWindowCompositionAttribute +
  ACCENT_ENABLE_ACRYLICBLURBEHIND). Pure compositor effect — no
  GL/D3D/DComp interop — so it cannot reproduce the GPU hang the
  per-pixel path caused (see Phase 5). Whole-window (text frosts too);
  pairs with background-opacity < 1. Verified on Windows 11, no hang.
  The crisp text-over-blur variant (DComp per-pixel, parked) remains the
  follow-up, to be attempted carefully if the frosted look isn't enough.
- [x] **Tab rename + font-family dropdown + cwd inheritance (2026-06-14)**
  — a batch of user-requested polish. (1) Right-click a tab → context
  menu (Rename / Close); rename is an in-strip editable field (own
  UTF-16 buffer + GDI paint + caret, the search-bar pattern — a
  subclassed EDIT didn't reliably capture input), stored as a per-tab
  custom_title override. (2) Settings window gained a Font-family
  dropdown populated from installed monospace families (GDI
  EnumFontFamiliesExW). (3) **OSC 7 cwd reporting implemented on
  Windows** (reportPwd was a no-op there): new tabs/windows now inherit
  the working directory, and tab titles show the cwd. Added an OSC 7
  emitter to the nushell integration (upstream's reports none); pwsh
  already reported it. `working-directory` (default dir) and
  `*-inherit-working-directory` (default on) were already config
  options; the missing piece was the Windows OSC 7 parse. Verified
  end-to-end with pwsh and nushell.

Still open if user pain demands: crash reporting (Sentry supports
Windows minidumps; upstream already integrates sentry).
- Then, **in order of observed user pain, not spec order:** splits; DirectWrite
  fallback hardening; quick-terminal global hotkey; tray; jump lists;
  default-terminal registration; D3D11 backend **only when GL driver telemetry
  demands it** (it is ~2k lines of COM + pipeline work with mostly-invisible
  payoff; the trigger is crash reports, not aesthetics); DWrite rasterization
  only on rendering complaints; ARM64 after x64 is stable.

### Phase 5 — Performance and efficiency (2026-06-12, in progress)

Measured on the 4K dev machine (ReleaseFast unless noted):

| Metric | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Startup to visible window | ~200 ms (debug and release) |
| Idle CPU | 0.2–0.3% of one core; ~42 MB working set |
| 100k pwsh lines end-to-end | 5.1 s — parity with classic conhost (4.9 s) |
| 10 MB single raw write | 1.25 s vs conhost 0.66 s — the gap is conhost's own re-render inside ConPTY, a tax every ConPTY-based terminal (incl. Windows Terminal) pays |
| Busy hidden tab | 9.7% → 8.6% of a core after the occlusion fix (and GPU draws eliminated entirely) |
| Debug vs ReleaseFast | 100k lines: 72 s vs 5.1 s (~14x) — README now steers builds to ReleaseFast |

Landed fixes:

- [x] **Renderer occlusion wiring**: `occlusionCallback` on tab
  switches (`Surface.setVisible`), window minimize (`WM_SIZE`), and
  quick-terminal hide/show. Occluded renderers skip cell rebuilds and
  draws entirely (previously only SwapBuffers was skipped).
- [x] **Strip GDI caching**: the two strip fonts are cached per DPI
  instead of being created/destroyed on every WM_PAINT (the strip
  repaints on every hover change).
- [x] **Resize-storm coalescing**: divider drags and interactive
  border resizes run the full per-split resize pipeline (ConPTY
  resize + renderer resize); both are throttled to ~60 Hz with an
  exact final layout on release/exit (WM_EXITSIZEMOVE).
- [x] **Hover repaint isolation**: strip hover changes invalidated the
  whole window, so crossing the tab strip redrew the terminal per
  hover change. Now: `invalidateStrip()` for strip-only changes,
  region-aware WM_PAINT (strip paints skip the renderer refresh and
  background fill; terminal paints skip the strip), and a fingerprint
  guard on the tooltip re-sync. Verified: a 60-toggle hover storm
  produced zero renderer activity (was one full refresh per toggle).
- [x] **window-vsync honored** (was hardcoded on): `window-vsync =
  false` now sets WGL swap interval 0 for minimum input latency;
  default remains on. Safety-checked: busy output with vsync off holds
  the same CPU as on (the renderer is damage-driven, no free-spin).
- Tried and rejected (both noted in-source so nobody retries blind):
  64 KB ConPTY read buffer (Exec.zig) and 128 KB ConPTY output pipe
  buffer (pty.zig) — both measured neutral on the 10 MB burst. The
  burst wall clock is conhost's re-render inside ConPTY; nothing on
  our side of the pipe moves it. The real lever is the Phase 4
  OpenConsole binaries drop (a newer, faster conhost).

- [x] **Perf tracing instrumentation** (`GHOSTTY_PERF_TRACE=1`,
  src/perf.zig): key→present latency (gated on the pty echo arriving,
  so cursor-reset presents don't consume the sample) logged by the
  renderer, and per-second io read/parse statistics (KB/s, chunk
  count/size, parse share of wall) logged by the read thread. Costs
  one relaxed atomic load per traced path when disabled.

Instrumented results (ReleaseFast):

| Metric | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Key→present (echo) median | 1.22 ms vsync on, 1.05 ms vsync off (p90 ≈ 2.1 ms both) — sporadic presents don't hit vsync backpressure; remaining photon latency is DWM's |
| Burst io profile (10 MB) | ConPTY delivers ~3.3 MB/s in ~307-byte chunks (~11k chunks/s); our parse is **6% of wall** — the read thread waits on conhost 94% of the time |

The burst numbers close the throughput question: nothing on our side
of the pipe is the bottleneck (also why the 64 KB read buffer and
128 KB pipe buffer experiments were neutral — conhost writes ~300 B at
a time). The only real throughput lever is the Phase 4 OpenConsole
binaries drop (newer conhost with faster ConPTY).

Methodology note: latency was measured by posting
KEYDOWN+CHAR+KEYUP 'a' presses at 150 ms spacing and taking the median
of the renderer's trace lines; bursts via a 10 MB single
[Console]::Write from pwsh.

User-reported "input lag while typing" (2026-06-12), investigated:
app-side key→present is 1.0–1.8 ms median in all four
pwsh/nu × opaque/95%-opacity combinations (nu is actually the fastest
echo path), so the pipeline is exonerated. The remaining suspects are
outside our metric's reach: (1) `background-opacity < 1` applies
WS_EX_LAYERED, which forces DWM's legacy redirected-surface
compositing — a known latency adder that occurs *after* present and
is invisible to in-app timing; (2) a fullscreen game running
concurrently (GPU/compositor contention). A/B feel test: comment out
background-opacity. The structural fix for transparency without the
layered-window penalty is a DirectComposition swap chain (also
unlocks per-pixel alpha and blur) — the largest remaining perf work
item.

- [x] **DXGI flip-model presentation (2026-06-12)** — the big one.
  SwapBuffers presented through DWM's redirected surface (blt model),
  costing 1–2 frames of compositor latency vs Windows Terminal's flip
  model; this was the user-felt typing lag. Now: hand-written minimal
  D3D11/DXGI COM bindings (dxgi.zig), a FLIP_DISCARD swapchain per
  surface with the frame-latency waitable capped at 1, GL sharing via
  WGL_NV_DX_interop2 into a stable intermediate texture (flip
  backbuffers rotate, so present() CopyResources into the current
  buffer — the standard interop pattern; registering the backbuffer
  directly renders black), Y-flipping blit from the GL default
  framebuffer, full fallback to SwapBuffers on any failure. Verified:
  splits, resizes, both panes presenting flip-model, app-side latency
  unchanged.

- [x] **PresentMon benchmarking + event-driven present fix
  (2026-06-13)**: instrumented three-way comparison (yuurei flip vs
  legacy vs Windows Terminal). Findings: (1) the first flip build
  felt *slower* because the frame-latency waitable was waited at
  frame start (game-loop pattern) — replaced with
  IDXGIDevice1::SetMaximumFrameLatency(1) and no wait, so Present
  alone throttles; (2) our swapchain presents as "Composed: Flip" but
  never promotes to the MPO hardware-overlay path ("Hardware
  Composed: Independent Flip") where WT spends 60% of frames and gets
  its 16.6 ms median — neither DXGI_SCALING_NONE nor
  WS_EX_NOREDIRECTIONBITMAP hosts (both kept; both are correct
  hygiene) unblocks an hwnd-bound child-window swapchain; (3) the
  legacy blt path's PresentMon numbers under-report (tracking ends at
  the copy). GHOSTTY_NO_FLIP escapes to the legacy path at runtime.

- [x] **DirectComposition presentation (2026-06-13)** — the swapchain
  is now a composition swapchain on a DComp visual bound to the host
  window (vtable layouts from mingw-w64's dcomp.h; SetContent is
  absolute slot 15, float overloads precede animation overloads).
  Measured with a same-session Windows Terminal control, unoccluded
  windows: yuurei 20.9 ms median display latency **vs WT 33.0 ms**,
  and yuurei now records "Hardware Composed: Independent Flip"
  frames. Key correction to the earlier comparison: WT's 16.6 ms
  figure came from a session where MPO promotion was active —
  promotion is environmental and varies per session; in matched
  conditions yuurei is currently the faster of the two. Also: windows
  overlapping the taskbar are occlusion-disqualified from promotion
  (a test-methodology trap).

- [x] **Wait-before-sample present pacing (2026-06-13)** — from a
  deep-research pass (106 agents, 22 verified findings; primary
  sources: Microsoft flip-model/latency docs, microsoft/terminal
  PR #6435, NVIDIA KB a_id/5157, PresentMon README). The verified
  Windows Terminal pattern: frame-latency waitable flag on the
  swapchain, default per-swapchain latency 1, wait on the waitable
  immediately BEFORE sampling terminal state on every damage event,
  Present(1,0) without blocking. Both of our previous designs were
  wrong in opposite directions (wait after sampling; then Present as
  the throttle) — each displays stale state. The first-ever wait must
  not be skipped (the semaphore starts full). Research also verified:
  composed-flip costs ~one vblank vs promoted MPO frames; DComp
  Commit is not on the per-present path (ours is already
  commit-free); the NVIDIA MPO registry kill switch is
  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm OverlayTestMode=5 (checked:
  NOT set on the dev machine, so session variance here is plane
  contention); DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_FLAG_ALLOW_TEARING + interval 0 can
  undercut even the waitable on MPO systems (candidate for a
  min-latency mode behind window-vsync=false).

**Known issue (pre-existing, not flip-related):** the shell prompt is
not repainted after window resizes — reproduced identically on the
legacy SwapBuffers path. Likely ConPTY-reflow interaction with our
resize pipeline; needs its own investigation.

- [x] **Classic presentation by default (2026-06-13)** — second
  deep-research pass (wezterm/alacritty source + camera measurements)
  found the GPU-terminal ecosystem has no answer to GDI conhost's
  33 ms keyboard-to-photon: WezTerm (ANGLE+swapinterval 0), Alacritty
  (WGL blt+vsync off+user pacing), and WT (flip+waitable) all
  measured 62–87 ms. Our PresentMon data matched (blt 17.3 ms vs flip
  19.05 ms medians). New `windows-flip-model` config (default false):
  classic SwapBuffers is the typing-latency default, always
  vsync-throttled (TDR footgun closed permanently); the flip+DComp
  stack stays as the opt-in for MPO eligibility and the transparency
  future. Verified both paths select correctly via config.

- [x] **The real latency bug: lost renderer wakeups (libxev IOCP),
  2026-06-13** — the headline. After every present-path experiment
  above failed to make typing feel as snappy as `wsl.exe`, a software
  photon-proxy benchmark (`bench/`, key injection → tight-loop screen
  capture until pixels change) finally measured the gap objectively:
  **Windows Terminal+WSL ~16.9 ms median, yuurei ~433 ms.** A 25×
  difference, not the sub-frame margins the present work was chasing.

  Pipeline tracing (`GHOSTTY_PERF_TRACE`, per-stage `key+Nms` logs)
  showed the echo was *processed* at key+0 ms — pty read, parse, and
  `queueRender` all fired immediately — but the renderer's next actual
  wake+present landed at key+433 ms. The tell: changing the benchmark's
  inter-sample settle from 600 ms to 950 ms moved the median to 150 ms.
  The latency was **phase-locked to the cursor-blink timer**: the
  renderer was only ever redrawn when the blink timer happened to fire,
  never by the keystroke itself.

  Root cause is in **libxev's `AsyncIOCP`**. It stored its notify state
  (`wakeup` flag, `waiter`) in inline struct fields. Ghostty copies the
  renderer thread's wakeup `Async` *by value* into termio
  (`renderer_wakeup = render_thread.wakeup`) before the renderer thread
  ever calls `wait()`. So the renderer registers its waiter on *its*
  copy, while termio's copy keeps `waiter == null` forever — every
  `queueRender → notify()` from the IO thread just sets a dead
  `wakeup = true` latch on termio's private copy and posts nothing to
  the loop. The eventfd (Linux) and mach-port (macOS) backends survive
  the same by-value copy because they hold a *shared kernel object*
  (an fd / a port) that copies fine; only the IOCP backend used
  copy-fragile inline state. An instrumented build confirmed the dead
  branch fired 35× during one bench run (`LATCHED count`), then 0×
  after the fix.

  Fix: **vendored libxev** (`vendor/libxev/`, `build.zig.zon` now
  points there) with `AsyncIOCP` heap-allocating its state behind a
  `*State` pointer, so by-value copies share one allocation and
  `notify()` through any copy reaches the registered waiter — the same
  shared-on-copy semantics the fd/port backends already have. Single
  owner deinits it (the copies are notify-only aliases, never deinit'd,
  exactly as on Linux), so no double-free. **Result: yuurei ~17 ms
  median, flat across settle times, `LATCHED count` 0** — parity with
  Windows Terminal, at the one-vblank 60 Hz compositor floor. This,
  not the present path, was what made `wsl.exe` "feel WAAAYYY snappier."

  Footnote that closes the vsync question for good: with the wakeup
  fixed, `window-vsync` on vs off measured **identical** (17.4 ms vs
  17.0 ms) on the classic path — the vsynced SwapBuffers does not add a
  frame here. So the classic path stays *always* vsync-throttled (the
  TDR footgun from the 2026-06-13 classic-default commit stays closed);
  there is no latency reason to expose interval 0, and an earlier
  attempt to honor `window-vsync=false` there was dropped as
  unnecessary risk.

Candidate future work: per-pixel transparency on the DComp visual
(premultiplied alpha — background-opacity without the layered-window
path; requires windows-flip-model), ALLOW_TEARING min-latency mode on
the flip path, the post-resize prompt repaint issue, and re-running
this table after upstream merges (the suite lives in this section).

## 5. Relationship to Upstream

**Decision (2026-06-12): yuurei is its own project, maintained permanently
as a fork. There is no intention to merge the port into upstream Ghostty.**
This supersedes the original "staging area, not a destination" framing.

What this changes:

- The fork *is* the destination. Code quality standards are ours to set;
  the practical bar stays "verified live + CI green on every commit."
- Upstream tracking still matters — it's how the shared core keeps
  improving underneath the port. `main` stays clean against upstream;
  `windows-port` rebases regularly (Rule 5 stands: divergence is debt).
  Keeping the win32 layer additive (new files; minimal shared-file
  churn) keeps that rebase cheap.
- Upstream's `AI_POLICY.md` contribution requirements don't bind this
  fork's internal work; AI assistance remains disclosed in the README
  for transparency. If anything were ever submitted upstream after all,
  the full human-review-and-ownership bar would apply first.

## 6. Salvage List from the `yurei` Attempt

The standalone repo (`marlboro-red/yurei`, see its `REVIEW.md` for the full
audit) is retired as a codebase but mined for:

| Asset | Disposition |
|---|---|
| ConPTY spawn sequence (attribute list, HPCON-by-value, handle-inheritance trick) | Reference for Phase 1 — it matched Microsoft's sample; fix the lifecycle/shutdown bugs documented in REVIEW.md Part 2 |
| Custom frame / DWM / resize-pipeline recipe | Reference for Phase 3 — validated as correct; rewrite on generated bindings |
| Comptime box-drawing table (U+2500–259F fill-rect rendering) | Possible direct port if upstream's font path doesn't already cover it better |
| REVIEW.md bug catalogue (chunk-boundary parsing, TranslateMessage trap, surrogate pairs, AltGr, GDI lifetimes, UTF-16 edge cases) | Becomes the Phase 3 input/window **test checklist** — every documented bug gets a regression test here |
| Everything else (terminal adapter, D3D11/DWrite stubs, custom config/input/mailbox) | Superseded by the real core in this tree |

---

## 7. Risk Register

| Risk | Exposure | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| ConPTY is a translating middleman (latency, sequence filtering, repaints) | Some Ghostty features degrade behind it; not fully fixable | Vendor OpenConsole (newest ConPTY always); document known degradations; watch upstream conpty passthrough work |
| Upstream churn against apprt/termio interfaces | Continuous rebase tax | Weekly rebases; upstream small pieces early so the surface we depend on stabilizes around us |
| POSIX assumptions run deeper than expected (Phase 0 overruns) | Schedule | Phase 0 is timeboxed to discovery first: a complete inventory of `posix.`/`fork`/fd usage before fixing; re-estimate at week 2 |
| Zig-on-Windows toolchain maturity (linker, libc corner cases) | Build breakage | Pin Zig to upstream's version; CI catches immediately; upstream Zig issues promptly |
| GL driver quality on Intel iGPUs / RDP | Rendering failures for a user slice | Known, bounded: software-GL hints and the explicit D3D11 escalation path |
| Code signing cost/process (SmartScreen) | Adoption at download | Budget the cert in Phase 4 week one, not at release |
| Solo-developer review bottleneck for upstream PRs | Throughput | Keep fork releasable independently; upstreaming is parallel, never blocking |

## 8. Milestone Summary

Timelines re-baselined after the §4a audit (Phase 0 collapsed from ~1 month
to days; Phase 2's GLFW shortcut is gone but its replacement seeds Phase 3).

| # | Milestone | Proof | Cumulative timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Fork Windows CI green on core (`apprt=none` build + tests) | CI badge | **Done 2026-06-11** |
| M1 | Shell round-trip headless via ConPTY | CI integration test | ~3–5 weeks |
| M2 | **Proof of life:** Ghostty/win32-skeleton running a live shell on Windows | Screenshot + daily use | **Render+input live 2026-06-11**; daily-drivability still open |
| M3 | Win32 apprt completed, default Windows build | Tabs, IME, paste, DPI all real | **Tabs/IME/paste/DPI all landed 2026-06-12; default flipped. Remaining: CJK-user IME verification + polish** |
| M4 | Signed v1 on winget | `winget install ghostty` | ~6–8 months |
| M5+ | Splits, quick terminal, D3D11-if-needed, ARM64 | By user pain | post-v1 |

*The previous plan's failure mode was not its architecture — it was building
breadth-first scaffolding that could never run. This plan's contract is the
inverse: at every milestone there is a smaller amount of code, all of which
runs, on the platform that matters.*
